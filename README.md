# hello-world

As the name says, hello-world! This is my first step towards programming, wow!!! So cool and exciting!

My name is Quan, living in Beijing now and worked as a scientist in a FMCG company. 

I will use this repo to record my learning in next 3 month. I believe this will open me a new door to the world!

Aza Aza Fighting!
